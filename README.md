#Kasio

Kasio is an open source ficto-chronographic publishing platform developed by [Halmos](http://www.halmos.us.com).
It has been the bases of a number of artist's and author's projects, including Dexter Sinister, Mark von Schlegel and Tauba Auerbach.

Kasio consists of a drop-in replacement PCB for the classic Casio F91W digital watch and a set of sourcecode libraries. The hardware schematic and PCB design may be found at [CircuitMake](http://circuitmaker.com/Projects/68CA89DE-237C-4FC6-A27B-16462CE2C86D). 
The sourcecode is hosted here.

Kasio is based on the MSP430 series ultra-low-power microcontroller and the code is developed using TI's Code Composer Studio IDE. 
A conversion boad and cable is required to connect a standard 2x5 JTAG header to the Kasio board.

Currently the demo application is very simple and only displays the current time. More advanced samples will be made available in the future.
